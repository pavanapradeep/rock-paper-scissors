Greetings!

This is a simple implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
- Backend - Spring Boot - 3.1.5 version
- Frontend - Angular versions
    Angular CLI: 16.2.8
    Node: 18.17.0
    Package Manager: npm 9.6.7
    OS: win32 x64
Flow of control:
- The endpoint BASEURL/api/play in GameController.java is called with the User's choice.
- Now, playGame() method in GameService.java is called with the User's choice.
  Here, Computer's choice is generated using Random, and using determineWinner() method the gameResult is obtained.
- CorsConfig.java is the Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing configuration that is permitting cross-origin requests specifically for the "/api/game/play" endpoint from "http://localhost:4200", allowing "GET" and "POST" requests, and allowing credentials to be included.
